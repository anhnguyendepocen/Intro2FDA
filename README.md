# Introduction to Functional Data Analysis

This repository contains the HTML-slides `Intro2FDA.html` of my short lecture **Introduction to Functional Data Analysis** at the *2nd Workshop on Statistics & Econometrics*, Jul. 13, 2018, University of Passau (Germany).


All practical examples can be reproduced using the accompanying R-codes in `Intro2FDA.R`. The latter file is generated by an automatic extraction of the R-codes in `Intro2FDA.html`. The layout of the R-codes in `Intro2FDA.R` is not perfect, due to the automatic extraction, but the content is complete.


The main source is the great textbook [**Introduction to Functional Data Analysis**](https://www.crcpress.com/Introduction-to-Functional-Data-Analysis/Kokoszka-Reimherr/p/book/9781498746342) of Piotr Kokoszka and Matthew Reimherr:
