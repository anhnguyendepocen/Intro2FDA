# Introduction to Functional Data Analysis (FDA)

This repository contains the HTML-slides `Intro2FDA.html` of my short lecture **Introduction to Functional Data Analysis** at the *2nd Workshop on Statistics & Econometrics*, Jul. 13, 2018, University of Passau (Germany). You can simply download them and view them using a (modern) browser with a [MathJax](http://mathjax.org/) plugin for rendering the LaTeX equations. The current versions of Chrome and Firefox should work directly.

All practical examples can be reproduced using the accompanying R-codes in `Intro2FDA.R`. The latter file is generated by an automatic extraction of the R-codes contained in `Intro2FDA.html`. The layout of the R-codes in `Intro2FDA.R` is not perfect, due to the automatic extraction, but the content is complete.

The slides are mainly based on the great textbook [**Introduction to Functional Data Analysis**](https://www.crcpress.com/Introduction-to-Functional-Data-Analysis/Kokoszka-Reimherr/p/book/9781498746342) of Piotr Kokoszka and Matthew Reimherr (two well-known experts in FDA):
